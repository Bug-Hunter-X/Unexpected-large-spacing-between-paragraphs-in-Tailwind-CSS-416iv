# Unexpected large spacing between paragraphs in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where unexpected spacing appears between paragraphs when using certain combinations of classes, specifically within a flex container.

## Bug Description
The bug is characterized by an unusually large spacing between paragraphs when using Tailwind CSS classes within a flex container. The issue doesn't seem directly related to the paragraph styles themselves, but rather an interaction with the flexbox layout and other classes.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.js` (or equivalent file in your framework) file and observe the rendered output in your browser.
3. Notice the excessive spacing between the paragraphs.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing and adjusting the Tailwind classes used in the flex container. In some cases, adding `text-left` or similar classes might resolve the issue, depending on the underlying context and other applied styles. Detailed solutions are available in the `bugSolution.js` file.
